Prediction using ML
Stock Price Prediction using Random Forest Regression
This project demonstrates how to predict stock closing prices using the Random Forest Regression algorithm from the sklearn library. The model is trained on stock market data and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.

ðŸ“Š Dataset:

The dataset should contain the following features:

Open: Opening price of the stock

High: Highest price of the stock for the day

Low: Lowest price of the stock for the day

Close: Closing price of the stock

Prev_Close: Previous day's closing price

Volume: Number of shares traded

# Models Implemented:

1.Time Series Models

* ARIMA
* LSTM networks

2.Supervised Learning Models

* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machines

# Train-Test Split:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80%-20% split).

Model Training:

A Random Forest Regressor is trained on the training set.

# Evaluation:

The model is evaluated using:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)

 * R-squared (RÂ²) score

Prediction (Optional):

You can use the trained model to predict the closing price for new stock data.

# Final decision:

The analysis also showed that the random forest algorithm has the
best accuracy because it received a 99.94% accuracy ratio in this work.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

The model in this example is trained on a very high-correlation dataset, which explains the extremely high RÂ² value. Be cautious about overfitting in real-world scenarios.
The current implementation assumes that all required features are present and properly preprocessed.
