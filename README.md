Prediction using ML
Stock Price Prediction using Random Forest Regression
This project demonstrates how to predict stock closing prices using the Random Forest Regression algorithm from the sklearn library. The model is trained on stock market data and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.9 or later

Jupyter Notebook

Required Python libraries:

pandas

scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using:
ðŸ’» Installation:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn  matplotlib

ðŸ“Š Dataset:
The dataset should contain the following features:

Open: Opening price of the stock

High: Highest price of the stock for the day

Low: Lowest price of the stock for the day

Close: Closing price of the stock

Prev_Close: Previous day's closing price

Volume: Number of shares traded

Models Implemented:
1.Time Series Models

* ARIMA
* LSTM networks

2.Supervised Learning Models

* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machines

ðŸ“Œ Replace the file path in the code with the correct path to your dataset if needed.

ðŸ›  Model Workflow
Data Loading and Preparation:
The stock data is read from a CSV file and relevant features are selected.

Train-Test Split:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80%-20% split).

Model Training:
A Random Forest Regressor is trained on the training set.

Evaluation:
The model is evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (RÂ²) score

Prediction (Optional):
You can use the trained model to predict the closing price for new stock data.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
The model in this example is trained on a very high-correlation dataset, which explains the extremely high RÂ² value. Be cautious about overfitting in real-world scenarios.

The current implementation assumes that all required features are present and properly preprocessed.
